# News-Category-Text-Classification
The objective of this assignment is to scrape a corpus of news stories from a set of web pages, pre-process the data, and evaluate the performance of both binary and multi-label text classification algorithms on the data.

Note: The static link mentioned in the commented code is not working as of now, directly keep the csv file in the same path as the notebook and run the whole notebook from the start.
